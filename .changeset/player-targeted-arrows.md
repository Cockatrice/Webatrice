Arrows can now be drawn from a card to a player. The player info panel header acts as the drop/click target during a right-click-drag or pending arrow click; the rendered line anchors to the life counter. Several supporting fixes were needed to make the round-trip work:

- proto2 field presence: `Command_CreateArrow` now omits `targetZone`/`targetCardId` for player targets so Servatrice routes the command via `has_target_zone()`/`has_target_card_id()` (omitting → player) rather than treating the empty defaults as a card lookup.
- Live `arrowCreated` reducer assigns the raw `ServerInfo_Arrow` proto into the store instead of `{ ...arrowInfo }`. Spreading a bufbuild proto2 message drops unset optional fields entirely, which caused live player-targeted arrows to land in state without `targetZone`/`targetCardId` and silently fail to render until the next game-state refresh.
- The cardMoved arrow-cleanup sweep now only runs on actual cross-zone moves, so repositioning a card within the battlefield no longer locally deletes its attached arrows.
