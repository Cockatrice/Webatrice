Hand and stack zones now support drag-and-drop reordering. Dragging a card within your hand or side-pile sends a same-zone `Command_MoveCard` with the target index, and a bright pale-yellow insertion bar lights up in the gap where the card will land — on the after-edge of the hovered slot when moving forward, on the before-edge when moving back. A new `cardMovedInSameZone` reducer handles the intra-zone splice without going through the cross-zone path, so no arrow sweep or attachment reparent fires on a simple reorder.

Under the hood, `useGameDnd.handleDragEnd` is split into a `classifyDrop` dispatcher plus small `resolveTableGridX` / `sendMoveCard` helpers. The DndContext also gets a custom `collisionDetection` that prefers reorder-slot droppables over their enclosing zone — without it, a 64×88 stack slot loses dnd-kit's default IoU tiebreaker against the wider stack column whenever the 146×204 drag overlay is in flight, which is why stack reorders silently failed before this change.
