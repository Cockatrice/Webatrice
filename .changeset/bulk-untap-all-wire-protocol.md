Untap-all now matches Cockatrice's wire protocol. Pressing F5 or double-clicking the Untap phase sends a single bulk `Command_SetCardAttr` with `card_id = -1` instead of one command per tapped card, so peers see every card untap in one frame and the chat log shows a single "untaps their permanents" line instead of N per-card lines. The inbound listener detects the bulk variant via `isFieldSet` (Servatrice omits `card_id` on the broadcast event for bulk operations) and applies the attribute to every card in the named zone in one reducer pass via a new `cardFieldsUpdatedBulk` action, so the local Webatrice UI now refreshes immediately on bulk untap without requiring a page reload.
