# @cockatrice/webatrice

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d235dc: Consolidated E2E docker infrastructure across the monorepo:

  - **Shared compose stack.** E2E docker stacks merged into a single `docker/servatrice/` directory at the monorepo root. Each package keeps only a tiny per-package env file (compose project name + host port) and invokes the shared compose via `docker compose --env-file <pkg>/.env.e2e -f ../../docker/servatrice/docker-compose.e2e.yml ...`. One servatrice image tag, one schema, one ini.
  - **`servatrice.sql` from the image.** The init SQL now comes from the pinned `ghcr.io/cockatrice/servatrice` image (extracted by a `servatrice-sql` sidecar into a shared volume mounted at `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`) instead of the Cockatrice submodule. Image tag is the single source of truth — schema and binary can't drift. The submodule still materializes `libcockatrice_protocol/` for proto generation.
  - **Image tag in env.** The servatrice image tag moved out of `docker-compose.e2e.yml` into the root `.env.e2e` (substituted via `${SERVATRICE_IMAGE}`). Bumping the Servatrice release is now a one-line edit at the monorepo root.
  - **Env files at package root.** Per-package env files moved from `packages/<pkg>/e2e/docker/.env` to `packages/<pkg>/.env.e2e`. The `.env.e2e` suffix (not plain `.env`) prevents Vite/vitest from auto-loading the compose vars during dev/test/build.

  After pulling, run `docker volume prune` once to clean up the old project-prefixed volumes (`webatrice-e2e_webatrice_e2e_mysql`, `sockatrice-e2e_cockatrice_e2e_mysql`); the new stacks use `*_mysql_data`. The shared ini sets `maxnamelength=16` (was 12 for Sockatrice) — Sockatrice's 10-char generated usernames still fit, no behavioral change.

- ecdcb35: Country flag SVGs now come from the `flag-icons` npm package instead of the `vendor/cockatrice` submodule. Refresh with `npm update flag-icons` — no submodule bump required.
- Updated dependencies [73513b3]
  - @cockatrice/datatrice@4.1.0

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Joined the unified monorepo release flow.** Webatrice now lives at `packages/webatrice/` alongside `@cockatrice/sockatrice` and `@cockatrice/datatrice`, with all three linked at v4.0.0 via [Changesets](../../.changeset/README.md). Subsequent changes that touch any of the three bump all three to the next shared version.
- **Versioning is now Changesets-driven.** The previous manual `npm version` bump in [`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) is gone; Changesets writes the version into `packages/webatrice/package.json` via the "Version Packages" PR. The downstream build / tarball / GitHub Release / deploy pipeline is unchanged in shape but reads the version from the manifest and tags releases as `@cockatrice/webatrice@<version>` to match the libraries' tag format.
- **Webatrice stays private.** Not published to GitHub Packages or any other registry; tarball-on-Release for `deploy.yml` remains the only distribution channel. Changesets honors `private: true` + `privatePackages.version: true` to version + tag without publishing.

### Notes

- Root manifest is now `cockatrice-web-stack` (private, version 0.0.0) — a thin orchestration package that owns `workspaces`, the shared `prepare` (submodule init + sockatrice codegen + husky), and a few cross-workspace convenience scripts. All app-specific scripts, dependencies, browserslist config, and configuration files now live under `packages/webatrice/`.
- Husky pre-commit hook updated to invoke `npm run -w @cockatrice/webatrice translate` and stage `packages/webatrice/src/i18n-default.json`.
